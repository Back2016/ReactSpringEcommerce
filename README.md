# E-Commerce Backend

This is the backend of a full-stack e-commerce application built with **Spring Boot**. It provides RESTful APIs for user authentication, product browsing, cart and order management, address book functionality, and Stripe-based payments. It features robust **JWT authentication** with access and refresh tokens, admin capabilities, and full support for **guest checkout**.

---

## Tech Stack

- Spring Boot 3
- Spring Security + JWT (Access & Refresh token strategy)
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL
- Stripe (Payment Intents API)
- ModelMapper (for entityâ€“DTO mapping)
- Lombok (for boilerplate reduction)
- Javax Validation + Spring `@Valid`
- Docker-ready

---

## Authentication & Authorization

- Secure login system using Spring Security
- JWT-based access token for authentication
- Refresh token endpoint to renew access tokens
- Role-based access:
  - User: can browse, place orders, manage addresses
  - Admin: can manage products and orders

---

## Stripe Integration

- Uses Stripe Payment Intents API
- Supports:
  - Creating client secret for secure frontend payments
  - Linking Stripe payments with internal order system
- Seamlessly integrates with both user and guest checkout flows

- All input is validated using `@Valid` and DTOs
- Errors are handled with centralized `@ControllerAdvice` logic
- Returns structured error responses for invalid input or unauthorized access
